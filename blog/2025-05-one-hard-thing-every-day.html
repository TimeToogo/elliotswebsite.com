                If you want to lead a meaningful life, you should do one hard thing every single day.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of the things that I'm the most proud of have one common thread: they were hard.

                <ul>
                    <li>Finishing side-projects</li>
                    <li>Buying a house</li>
                    <li>Being able to run again</li>
                    <li>Immigrating to the US</li>
                    <li>Building a world-class team</li>
                    <li>Starting a company</li>
                    <li>Helping others along the way</li>
                </ul>

                They were hard because they took time, persistent and sustained effort, faced significant set backs, had moments of crisis, required personal sacrifice, 
                or encountered times when I had no idea what to do next. Overcoming these challenges was immensely satisfying. Seeing them through to completion has
                brought a huge source of meaning to my life. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another way to put this is that every big thing you want is on the other side of many smaller things you don't. 
                Things are hard because you do not want to do them. Doing the things you do not want to sucks, all of the time.

                Yet, it is ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. I do not understand why it is this way, but the world works on people doing things they do not want to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                The specific things will vary from person to person, but I believe that learning to do hard things is the same for everyone.
                And I believe it is fundementally the same as learning any other skill. It requires practice. I strongly recommend daily practice.
                By definition, this is something you do not want to do, so it is extremely easy to let it slip. Working it into your routine is a solid antidote for this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Personal list of hard things:

                <ul>
                    <li>Cold shower <small>Trite, but it works great, easy to work into a routine and wakes you up quick</small></li>
                    <li>Running</li>
                    <li>Self-guided learning or study</li>
                    <li>Getting truly hungry before your next meal</li>
                    <li>Cold plunge + sauna</li>
                </ul>

                Hopefully these are helpful!
